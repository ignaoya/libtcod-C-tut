## Making a Roguelike in C Using libtcod

This is my humble attempt at making a tutorial on how to
use libtcod to write a roguelike in C. I was prompted to
do this because of my own failed search for libtcod
tutorials in C. 

However, I am neither a proficient C programmer,
nor acquainted with libtcod at the moment, so this
tutorial will probably take a while as I am learning
to do this myself. I have used the more pythonic port 
of the libtcod library, tdl, and since I liked that
so much and I'm learning C at the moment, I thought
that it would be great to make a roguelike in C and
propel my learning forward through the sheer joy of
making a game. 

If you take a look at what I have and you see something's
wrong, please let me know.
