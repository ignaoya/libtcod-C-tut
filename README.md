## Making a Roguelike in C Using libtcod

This is my humble attempt at making a tutorial on how to
use libtcod to write a roguelike in C. I was prompted to
do this because of my own failed search for libtcod
tutorials in C. I've done TStand90's python tdl port of 
the c++ tutorial, and I'm trying to do a similar port
of that tutorial for C, although I'll probably change
a few things along the way just for fun.  


### Useful Resources

The following are links to the resources I'm consulting
in order to figure out how to do this.

[The libtcod documentation page](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/index2.html?c=true&cpp=true&cs=false&py=true&lua=false)

[TStand90's tutorial pages](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) is a great resource, 
though for some reason, his python3-tdl tutorial is not
up at the moment.
