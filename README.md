## Making a Roguelike in C Using libtcod

This is my humble attempt at making a tutorial on how to
use libtcod to write a roguelike in C. I was prompted to
do this because of my own failed search for libtcod
tutorials in C. I've done TStand90's python tdl port of 
the c++ tutorial, and I'm trying to do a similar port
of that tutorial for C, although I'll probably change
a few things along the way just for fun.  

However, I am neither a proficient C programmer,
nor acquainted with libtcod at the moment, so this
tutorial will probably take a while as I am learning
to do this myself. I have used the more pythonic port 
of the libtcod library, tdl, and since I liked that
so much and I'm learning C at the moment, I thought
that it would be great to make a roguelike in C and
propel my learning forward through the sheer joy of
making a game. 

If you take a look at what I have and you see something's
wrong, please let me know.


### Disclaimer and Warning

In case it isn't clear yet, this project is not only 
a work in progress, but a work in learning as well, 
as in, I still don't know what the hell I'm doing when 
I program in C. Although I might break the code from
time to time, I'm not going to add anything to the
tutorial pages until I've gotten it compiled and
running. That said, you should not expect to learn
good C style from it, as I'm in the process of 
learning it myself.


### Useful Resources

The following are links to the resources I'm consulting
in order to figure out how to do this.

[The libtcod documentation page](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/index2.html?c=true&cpp=true&cs=false&py=true&lua=false)

[TStand90's tutorial pages](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) is a great resource, 
though for some reason, his python3-tdl tutorial is not
up at the moment.
