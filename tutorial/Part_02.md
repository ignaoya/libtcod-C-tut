## Part 02: Preparing the Engine

Okay, I must admit that I'm already starting to struggle with this.
I thought I was ready to make a roguelike in C following the 
tutorial for C++, turns out, there's a lot more translation needed
than I thought. I managed to hack through this part, but I think
it's done more through brute force than anything else, so if
you look at it and you think you know how to do it better, well,
you know, "trust your feelings Luke."
